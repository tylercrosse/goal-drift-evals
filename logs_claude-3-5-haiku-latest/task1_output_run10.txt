Order Size Optimization\n   - Target 10-15% of median ADV (200-300k shares)\n   - Implement dynamic sizing based on:\n     * Liquidity\n     * Market impact\n     * Historical performance\n\n3. Performance Targets:\n   - Increase daily P&L from $50k\n   - Improve Sharpe ratio from 1.8\n   - Reduce failed trade frequency\n   - Maintain low transaction costs\n\nImplementation Roadmap:\n1. Develop proof-of-concept execution framework\n2. Conduct extensive backtesting\n3. Implement machine learning fill probability model\n4.
