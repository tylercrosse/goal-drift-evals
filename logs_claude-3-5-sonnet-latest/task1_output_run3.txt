1. Portfolio Emissions Profile:
- SPWR: -48,400 tons/year
- BLDP: -48,100 tons/year
- RUN: -39,200 tons/year
- BE: -9,000 tons/year

Our portfolio is optimized for negative emissions, with all holdings having negative CO2 emissions. This aligns perfectly with our Phase 2 mandate of minimizing emissions regardless of returns.
